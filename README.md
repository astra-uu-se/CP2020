# CP2020
Public files for 'Solving Satisfaction Problems using LNS' paper of CP2020.


## Evaluation
The models, data files, flattened files, and solver ouput can be found in the `benchmarks` folder.


## Implementation
The implementation of non-failing propagators in Gecode can be found at (https://github.com/GustavBjordal/gecode-subsuming).
Note that during devlopment, non-failing propagators were called 'self-subsuming' propagators, hence the naming of flags, comments, and output may refer to 'self-subsuming propagators' or just 'subsuming propagators'.


## Todo:
